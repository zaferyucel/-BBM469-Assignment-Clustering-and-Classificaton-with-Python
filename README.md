Jupyter Notebook of BBM469 Assignment

In this assignment, I have tried to detect haricot bean species,using machine learning methods from the features created by digitizing the images of the various haricot beans. In this assignment, I have used clustering and classification methods with original and normalized data then I have made comment on the results. While doing these I have dealt with missing values if exist and I have made feature selection.
